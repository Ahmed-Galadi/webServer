❌ errno checking after recv/send → Grade: 0
- root should behave like alias:
	Example:
		location /images/ {
			alias /var/www/assets/pictures/;
		}
		If a request comes in for /images/logo.png,
		Nginx will replace /images/ with /var/www/assets/pictures/,
		resulting in the file being served from /var/www/assets/pictures/logo.png.

- Index of location
- 504 (GateWay timeout) in case of infinite loop
- If no arguments are passed the default conf should run
- client_body_timeout (OPT)
- client_max_body_size
- setup with different hostnames
- duplicated ports in the same server block
- return 301 https://youtube.com;
	return directive only works with 301/302/307
- Multiple recv() calls per epoll event → Possible violation
- CGI I/O operations might not go through epoll → Needs verification



- limit body size(get from main branch) -------IMPORTANT-------
